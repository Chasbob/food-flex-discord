# Contributing
This project is pretty much done, apart from the odd tweak. It started as a project in a private repository (with private tokens... oops), so a lot of the development is hidden. I've been working on this since October 2018, and finally think it's at a good point. 

That doesn't mean that you can't contribute to Food Flex....

## Summer 2019
This summer, I'm planning to develop a platform just for Food Flex. If you're interested, updates will be posted on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WilliamR__).

### Current ideas

- Web server built in Python, using Flask.
- Mobile app built in Dart, using Flutter.
