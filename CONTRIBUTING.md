# Contributing

Currently, we're changing how Food Flex works internally. Will is going to highlight these improvements, bugs, refactors using the GitHub issues for this repository. If you'd like to contribute, create a fork and try and create a solution for one of the solutions.

We will test your fork in an isolated test server, ensuring that it works as intended for Food Flex. If we're happy with the quality, we will merge it. If you have any questions, you can email Will (on his profile) or Tweet him at [@WilliamR](https://twitter.com/WilliamR__).

When you make a pull request, please give a brief description to your change, e.g:
- What's its purpose
- What it changes
- How it will make Food Flex better
